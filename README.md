[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/julleboi/psychic-rotary-phone/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/julleboi/psychic-rotary-phone/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Demo

## Description
```
Create a web page that renders book listing. Use React.

- You can use other libraries as well but your solution must be based on React.
- You can demonstrate it from your laptop or deploy it somewhere.
- You are expected to walk through the source code and explain the design.
- Use git to do commits during implementation.

Fetch the dataset with curl or similar due to cross origin restrictions: "https://kirja.elisa.fi/api/search?limit=36&sort=relevance&order=desc&q=salaisuus".

- The idea is to display the books in a grid. It does not have to look like existing Elisa Kirja.
- You can choose which fields to display from the JSON.

Optional features to implement:
- switch between grid and list view
- responsiveness 
- local sorting
- other features you would like to show
```
